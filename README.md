# UnhideNPCs

Ever been annoyed that enemies, bosses and NPCs disappear when many players are nearby?  
UnhideNPCs keeps them visible.

Using this, you could even put `Character Model Limit` to `Lowest` and still see all enemies/bosses/NPCs!

## Notes
UnhideNPCs works as expected in my testing, but it hasnâ€™t been widely used yet. Use with caution, as unforeseen issues may appear.

UnhideNPCs does nothing while in PvP or WvW.

When using the Nexus or ArcDPS there is in-game configuration available, in proxy or injected modes you need to manually edit the config file)

Tested on Windows 11 25H2 and Fedora Linux 42 (GE-Proton10-20).

## Installation
There are four different ways to use UnhideNPCs; you only need to follow one of them.

### 1) Nexus (recommended)
1. It's available in-game in the Nexus Library
   - When you are using Nexus, a configuration menu is available in-game

   - `Images may or may not be out of date, and not show the latest options`



### 2) ArcDPS
1. Download `UnhideNPCs.dll` from [Releases](https://github.com/server-imp/UnhideNPCs/releases).
2. Place it in your game folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Guild Wars 2`).
3. ArcDPS will load the plugin automatically on next launch.

   - `Images may or may not be out of date, and not show the latest options`
   - Hotkey: ALT+SHIFT+U



### 3) DLL Proxy
1. Download `UnhideNPCs.dll` from [Releases](https://github.com/server-imp/UnhideNPCs/releases).
2. Rename it to one of the following: `dxgi.dll`/`midimap.dll`/`d3d9.dll`.
   - Note: `midimap.dll` does not appear to work on Linux/Proton in my tests
3. Place it in your game folder.
4. The game will load it automatically on next launch.

### 4) Manual injection (for developers/testing mainly)
1. Inject `UnhideNPCs.dll` using your injector of choice, a simple one is included in the project for convenience.
2. When injected:
   - A console window will open for logs (closing it will also close the game).
   - Press `END` to unload the plugin so it can be reloaded without restarting the game.
